c1. 
Gates:
examples:
注意：in lecturenote0, Part of Delay, which mentions rise and fall time.
1.1.
or #(4,3) ig(o,a,b); // the or gate is called ig(instance name); rise time = 4, fall time = 3
xor #(5) xor1(a,b,c); // a=b xor c after five time units, the gate is called xor1
xor (pull1,strong0) #5 (a,b,c); // Identical gate with pull-up strength pull1 and pull-down strength strong0
 what is strength
1.2.
buf c1 (o,p,q,r,in); // buffers, have one input and one or more outputs
1.3.
Three-state gates:
// They propagate z signal if their control signal is deasserted.
// They can have three delay specifications: rise time, fall time, a time to go into 3-state

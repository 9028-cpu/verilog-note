1.
Functions:
// A function is a part of code which may be reused, so need to separate from the other parts in a module
/* Syntax:
	function [size_or_type] function_name;
	 input declarations
	 local variable declarations
	 procedural statements
	endfunction    */
//size_or_type is optional, it's the returned type or range as [msb:lsb]. The default is a 1-bit value.
//Functions should have at least one input
//Functions are only defined within a module
//The function name serves as the 

2. 
Tasks:
// A task is a part of code which may be reused, so need to separate from the other parts in a module
/* Syntax:
	task task_name;
	 input declarations
	 output declarations
	 local variable declarations
	 procedural statements
	endtask    */
//A task may have any number of inputs,ouputs, inouts
//A task does not return any value by its name
